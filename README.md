# pegasus-site-catalogs
This repo hosts the default Pegasus site catalogs available for training using pegasus-init.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
The repo works based on the major and minor revisions of Pegasus WMS.</br>
When a new MAJOR.MINOR version is being released a new branch named MAJOR.MINOR needs to be created.</br>
pegasus-init is looking for the site catalogs based on the Pegasus version and that's why this is necessary.</br>

## Current branches that exist:
- master
- 5.0 (for Pegasus 5.0.x)
- 5.1 (for Pegasus 5.1.x)
